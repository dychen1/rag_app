## Context

Provide enough context so a reader can open the PR and understands what it does without needing you to explain.

Good things to have:

- Explains briefly **what** the PR is about.
- Link to the related JIRA ticket to provide more details.

## Changes

Bullet points of things you changed in the codebase.

It should be a short guide to help understand the code diff.

## Verification

Screenshots or link to dashboard showing the changes.
